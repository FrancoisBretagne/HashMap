# HashMap

Here is my project for creating a Hashmap, containing 4 dot c files. One to manage the tree, the second to manage the queue, the third to manage the Hashmap and the fourth, the main, to call the functions of the previous 3.
There's also a dot h file containing all my functions and a makefile allowing me to compile my functions together.
You can compile the program with the make command, then ./exx to run the code.
